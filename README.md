Where are these bloody heads coming from? A simple doom mod that turns your regular fist in a eyelander style of weapong from Team Fortess 2. On every kill your
fist damage is multiplied by the kill count of the map. This is overpowered but fun ^^ My first shot at a Doom mod. This works with GZDoom and can be loaded with
the following command:

```
$ gzdoom -iwad <Your_wad_file_path>.wad -file <path_to_zdoomlander>/zdoomlander.pk3
```
